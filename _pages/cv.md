Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR) and Business Administration from the State University of Northern Paraná (UENP) master in Computer Science and Software Engineering (ES) at UTFPR; PhD in the area of ES at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Computing at the University of São Paulo (ICMC/USP), supported by FAPESP and CAPES; post-doctoral student at ICMC/USP in the area of ES. Working in software development in industry, I use this experience to teach technical technology courses and higher education, mainly in relation to emerging technologies associated with industry 4.0. My main area of research is evidence-based SE (EBSE), more specifically, my work is focused on optimizing the process of obtaining evidence from literature by introducing the concept of sustainability in the context of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) . Furthermore, I work in partnership with the software engineering laboratory (LABES) and the software architecture research group at ICMC/USP looking for innovative ways to produce more relevant evidence for decision-making in the software industry.
