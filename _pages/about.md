Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR) and Business Administration (UENP); Master in Computer Science and Software Engineering (ES) from UTFPR; PhD in ES from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Computing of the University of São Paulo (ICMC/USP), supported by FAPESP and CAPES; post-doctorate at ICMC/USP in the area of ​​ES. Working in software development in the industry, I use this experience to teach in technical technology courses and in higher education, mainly in relation to emerging technologies associated with Industry 4.0. My main research area is evidence-based SE (EBSE), more specifically, my work is focused on optimizing the process of obtaining evidence from the literature by introducing the concept of sustainability in the context of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR). In addition, I work in partnership with the software engineering laboratory (LABES) and the software architecture research group at ICMC/USP, looking innovative ways to produce more relevant evidence for decision-making in the software industry.

## My interests

My research interests are rooted in software engineering, with a strong focus on systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and evidence-based software engineering. I am particularly passionate about sustainability in software engineering, including the sustainability of SLR practices and processes. My work seeks to enhance the rigor and efficiency of research methodologies while addressing practical challenges in the field.

In short they are:

  - Software Engineering
  - Systematic Literature Reviews
  - Evidence-Based Software Engineering
  - Sustainability
  - Sustainability of SLR


## Partnerships

I'm always looking for partnerships in research and novelties in several research topics. We can work together if you are interested in Systematic Reviews as a research topic or only trying to conduct one and is struggling with the research method. I'm particularly interested in evolving the concept of sustainability of SLR into a first-class citzen in Software Engineering.
