This research to practice full paper observed that
graduate subjects (or courses) are commonly offered in graduate
programs and can provide specialized knowledge of different
topics that are important for the formation of Ph.D. and Masterâ€™s
students. At the same time, Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
has been increasingly adopted in the computing area as a
research method to synthesize the state of the art of a given
research topic, identify research groups working on that topic,
understand the existing limitations and research gaps, and also
identify new research directions. However, it is still not well
understood the real benefits and challenges of offering a subject
that addresses SLR for graduate students. Moreover, it is not
known the difficulties faced by professors (i.e., educators) to
teach this subject. The main goal of this paper is to present
an experience report of teaching SLR, in particular, the benefits
and challenges of this subject for computer science graduate
students. In addition, this paper also presents the essential topics
of SLR that we recommend to be taught and a better way
to teach them, aiming at supporting graduate courses to offer
it. For this, we surveyed computer science graduate students
who attended the SLR subject that was taught for almost ten
years in our institutions. In particular, we collected the lessons
learned, findings, and insights; following, we summarized the
benefits and challenges for students, the difficulties for professors,
and also those essential topics to be taught. As a main result,
the SLR subject can be considered a valuable opportunity for
graduate students that could use this subject to conduct the
required deep literature review of their research topic and have
a better comprehension of their research area. Besides and more
importantly, this subject can improve important research skills
of students, including the ability to recognize research problems,
analyze and synthesize data, think critically, and write papers.
Therefore, we believe that graduate courses should analyze the
possibility of offering the SLR subject.
